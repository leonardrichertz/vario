Welcome to our PWA variometer!
This repository provides the necessary html, css and javascript code for you to integrate our varionmeter on your website. Please keep in mind, that we are using vanilla JS and JQuery and are not providing a functionality to save flight data on our system. The corresponding endpoints and the logic to store and save the data have to be configured by the user.

To adjust the sound output sensitivity based on your needs adjust the following variable "maxSpeed" in the file src/utils/altitudeUtils.js, which should be the maximum velocity in m/s you'll achieve while using this application.
