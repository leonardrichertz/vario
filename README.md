Welcome to our PWA variometer!
This repository provides the necessary html, css and javascript code for you to integrate our varionmeter on your website. Please keep in mind, that we are using vanilla JS and are not providing a functionality to save flight data. The corresponding endpoints have to be configured by the user.
